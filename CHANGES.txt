(1) Changed: The step size dh is now estimatet more balanced by using 
    individual dh's for each t-map.
(2) Changed: Main function cg_tfce_estimate is now loading all data once into a 
    matrix Y. This is resulting in a large speed improvement but memory 
    demand increases with sample size.
(3) Changed: Now use pthread for tfce calculation with new tfceMex_pthread.c.
(4) Fixed: Issues with new matlab version and cg_progress.m
(5) Changed: Graphical output is now only drawn 100 times to save time.

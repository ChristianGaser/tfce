# TFCE: Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement
This toolbox is a an extension to [SPM12](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology) to provide non-parametric statistics based on threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). The idea of the TFCE approach is to combine focal effects with large voxel height as well as broad effects. In contrast to common approaches that consider cluster-based thresholding no initial (and arbitrary) cluster-forming threshold is necessary. Furthermore, TFCE is fairly robust to nonstationarity in the data, which can be often seen in VBM data.

The toolbox can be applied to (almost) any existing statistical (parametric) SPM design for 3D volume or surface data.
